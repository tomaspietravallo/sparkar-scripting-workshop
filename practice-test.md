# Practice test

## Prompt:

Write a script, where you:
- Store the following Array: `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`
- Create a function that increments each number in the array by one
- Call this function ten times

## To write your code

You can write the code in any way / code editor you want, as long as you are comfortable with what you choose.

It is recommended that you use Visual Studio Code, as it's the code editor we'll be using to teach this workshop, and is the one preferred by Spark AR Studio. If you want to execute your code (not required), you can use the LeetCode playground

### Visual Studio Code

To start writing your script in Visual Studio Code:
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. `> File > New File`
3. Select `Javascript` or `Typescript` as your language
4. Start writing

You can also create a new Spark AR Project, head to the asset panel, create a new script (for this test, either Javascript or Typescript are OK), and open it in your code editor of choice.

<!-- ### LeetCode playground **Modify to playground.arprojpkg**
For these exercises, you can also try out using the [LeetCode playground](https://leetcode.com/playground/new/empty). Which will allow you to execute the code you write

Note that if you use LeetCode playground you can use the "Run code" button to execute, and if you do have a missing symbol/typo/other error, you will get a message letting you know where the error is found. Additionally, you can use the `console.log` function to print out data, for example: 

```js
let x = 1;
console.log(x); // this will print out the number 1
x++;
console.log(x); // this will print out 2
``` -->

## How to tell if I passed

See the [practice-test-answer.md](practice-test-answer.md) file to compare your answer.

You're probably wondering if there's a way to run/ execute your code and tell if it does well, instead of just comparing. The answer is that you'll learn how to run your code inside of Spark AR Studio later on, but for now, if you really want to execute your code, you can try using the [playground](playground.md)

## The actual test

The real test will be similar to this one, don't worry, I won't try to trick you. However, for obvious reasons, you don't have the answers to that one.

You'll be presented a prompt, and asked to code out a solution (exactly like in the sample test). You'll need to send back your answer for it to be graded.

Just like in the sample test, it's not required that your code runs perfectly. If you happen to miss some symbol or misspell something, it's completely ok. I only care about the fact that you can reason through the prompt, and come up with a solution

You'll be able to send your answer as either a file, or by copying & pasting the answer into a text box
