# sparkar-scripting-workshop
Part of the first Javascript workshop for Spark AR (study group 1)

This workshop is headed by [@tomaspietravallo](https://github.com/tomaspietravallo), and is based around the philosophy that "Learning has to be fun and interesting" thus, I'll be fast forwarding through lots of basics and fundamentals, so participants can get to the stage where they can visualize their code inside of Spark AR Studio and create experiences on their own. Material focused on the fundamentals and more advanced concepts will be provided to those who wish to delve deeper after the workshop.

## Backstory

The idea for this workshop sparked during [a conversation in the community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SparkARcommunity/posts/1243573719388001), in which a sizeable demand for content centered around scripting was noticed.

After [this post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SparkARcommunity/posts/1245275375884502/), over a 120 submissions were received expressing interest in the workshop

 <summary>Some data about those... <br><br></summary>

Of the submissions received:
- About 90% had previously created and published an effect

- 32% were made by people determined to be complete beginners to programming

- 31% knew basic programming concepts

- 15% knew Javascript already (were determined to have enough pre existing knowledge to skip the pre-study)

- 21% of people did not provide enough information to be reasonably assessed

- Only 24 submissions were selected for the first study group

A big thanks goes out to the team at Facebook, who immediately reached out to help facilitate the event once they learned about it.

 
## Workshop roadmap

## Content
- [pre-study.md](pre-study.md) a list of content to be studied before the actual
- [practice-test.md](practice-test.md) a sample test that can be used to measure one's knowledge before the actual test
- [practice-test-answer.md](practice-test-answer.md) use this answer of the practice test to compare against your own. Do not open before attempting to solve the test
- [playground](playground) a Spark AR project you can use to play around with different concepts

## Speaker/ educator content
> **These files are NOT intended for workshop participants**, they contain more technical language, and may confuse or shy away beginners! They are targeted at other developers who may want to hold their own events and/or see the reasoning behind the choices made

[Here are few files](speaker-files) made available to all of those who wish to replicate this workshop, either by translating into other languages and/or running similar events

If you model your own event after this workshop, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tomaspietravallo/sparkar-scripting-workshop/issues) or contact me. I'll list your event here, and try my best to promote it
